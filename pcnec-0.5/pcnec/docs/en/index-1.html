Pcnec is a simple command-interface program which permit to program Nec 78k/0 and Nec 78k/0s
8 bit flash microcontrollers using a very simple interface connected to the PC parallel port.<br>
It was originally written for Linux, but it can be compiled for several other unices OS making
little modifications to the microdelay.c routine.<br>
Because Nec flash microcontrollers require very long time to be pre-written, erased and verified,
Pcnec was been written optimizing all timings, expecially those which were reporting uncorrectly
on the Nec flash specifications.<br><br>

<dl>
<dt>V0.5 - 2003-05-13<dd><ul>
<li>Added new command line parameter <b>-p #VppPulses</b> to set the number of pulses that
must be sent to the Vpp line during power-up (default 0): this is useful for 78F0078 or other devices
that should be programmed to SPI interface other that 0.
<li>Added new command line parameter <b>-l #LoopsPerMicroSecond</b> which is used in Windows/CygWin
environment to set how many operation the CPU will perform in a microsecond.<br>
The default value is 75, which is good to obtain 1uS timings in a PII 333MHz.<br>
This is not used for timings longer than 10uS (when it is used usleep() function to established
correct timings) and it is not used on Linux (which has precise 1uS timing).
