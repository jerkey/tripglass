If you got the pcnec executable file, just copy it to a directory included in your PATH environment
variable, for example <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt>.<br>
Then try to execute it typing, from the shell, <tt>pcnec -h</tt> ; if you get an error like
"command not found", you have not copied the pcnec executable to a directory in your PATH; in this
case you can run program typing <tt>./pcnec -h</tt> from the directory within the binary file.<br>

</H2>
Pcnec was written by Paolo Subiaco, and you are free to download the software, interface schematic and
information from the url <a href="http://www.creasol.it/">http://www.creasol.it/equipment/</a>.<br>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Requirements</A>
</H2>
You need a PC compatible with a parallel port (don't worry if it is
shared with your printer or scanner), with GNU/Linux or Windows/Cygwin operating systems<br>
<b>It does NOT run correctly on every PC</b> because some parallel port interface
are not very low impedance so it can be little reflections on the parallel cable:
<b>using a flat cable to connect interface to the PC, long as minimum as possible can be
a good chance to get interface working on every PC!</b>
